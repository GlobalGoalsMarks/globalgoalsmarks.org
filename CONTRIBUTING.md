# Contributing to Global Goals Marks

üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Thank you for contributing!

We love issues and pull requests from everyone.
If you're not comfortable with those features of GitHub, you can also just [start a discussion](https://github.com/GlobalGoalsMarks/globalgoalsmarks.org/discussions).

## Direction

When contributing, it might be helpful to know what we want this tool to be.

This tool will help someone create a rich visualization of the impact a project has on the Sustainable Development Goals (also called the Global Goals).
It covers all 169 targets of the 17 goals and shows both positive and negative impacts of the project to enable transparent decision making. 

## Problems, suggestions and questions in issues

Please help development by reporting problems, suggesting changes and asking questions.
To do this, you can [create a GitHub issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) for this project in the [GitHub Issues for the website](https://github.com/govdirectory/website/issues/new).

In particular, we use the tags [good first issue](https://github.com/GlobalGoalsMarks/globalgoalsmarks.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) so that you can see where you can start and [help wanted](https://github.com/GlobalGoalsMarks/globalgoalsmarks.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) where we still need input.

You don't need to change any of our code or documentation to be a contributor!

## Documentation and code in pull requests

If you want to add to the documentation or code of one of our projects you should make a pull request.

If you never used GitHub, get up to speed with one of the great free interactive courses in the [GitHub learning lab](https://lab.github.com/) on working with GitHub and working with MarkDown, the syntax this project's documentation is in.

This project is [licensed CC-0](LICENSE.md), which essentially means that the project, along with your contributions is in the public domain in whatever jurisdiction possible, and everyone can do whatever they want with it.

### 1. Make your changes

In this project we use branches for changes and don't usually commit direct to the main branch.
When you've forked this repository, please make sure to create a feature branch.

Add your changes in commits [with a message that explains them](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).
Document choices or decisions you make in the commit message, this will enable everyone to be informed of your choices in the future.

If you are adding code, make sure you've added and updated the relevant documentation and tests before you submit your pull request.
Make sure to write tests that show the behavior of the newly added or changed code.

### 2. Pull request

When submitting the pull request, please accompany it with a description of the problem you are trying to solve and the issue numbers that this pull request fixes.

### 3. Improve

All contributions have to be reviewed by someone.

It could be that your contribution can be merged immediately by a maintainer.
However, usually, a new pull request needs some improvements before it can be merged.
Other contributors (or helper robots) might have feedback.
If this is the case the reviewing maintainer will help you improve your documentation and code.

If your documentation and code have passed human review, it is merged.

## Feedback

You can also help by [telling us](https://github.com/GlobalGoalsMarks/globalgoalsmarks.org/discussions) how you would like to use a resource like this.
